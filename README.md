__Song style homogeniser for openlp__

Batch processing of song lyrics in the OpenLP database to make their styles homogenous (e.g. all choruses in italics)

## Building

To create a standalone executable using ```pyinstaller```, run ```pyinstaller drone.py -F```. An automated build system will be added later.
