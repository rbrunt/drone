The Father of our Lord

For pure and blameless in His sight 
He destined us to be 
And now we’ve been adopted through 
His Son eternally ]]></verse><verse type="c" label="1"><![CDATA[{it}To the praise of Your glory

Who gives His grace in Christ 
In Him our sins are washed away

The myst’ry of His will 
That Christ should be the head of all 
His purpose to fulfill ]]></verse><verse type="v" label="3"><![CDATA[Come praise and glorify our God 
For we’ve believed the Word 
And through our faith we have a seal 
The Spirit of the Lord

Until redemption’s done 
Until we join in endless praise 
To God, the Three in One]]></verse></lyrics></song>
